Platform, or information about your credit from a credit bureau or other background check service. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or services we provide.
Cookies and Other Technologies
We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, beacons, and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, deliver tailored advertising, and improve the products and services we provide. We or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in emails to end users, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. You can choose to accept or decline certain cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline certain cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from accessing or taking full advantage of the Platform.
Web Logs
In conjunction with the gathering of data through cookies, Web servers may log records such as your device type, operating system type, device advertising identifier, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located. The Web server logs also may record the address of the Web page that referred you to our website, the IP address (and associated city and state or province for the IP address) of the device you use to connect to the Internet, and data about your interaction with our website, such as which pages you visit.
Online Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services, such as those provided by Google Analytics. These service providers use cookies and other technologies described in this Policy to help us analyze how users use our Platform. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. To prevent Google Analytics from using information for analytics, a user may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on by clicking  here .
Tailored Advertising
We may use advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Platform and about GreatAt on other websites  you visit and other applications you use . The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ZWILLGEN DRAFT 5-5-17
visiting, your location, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.  These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
We may use third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to help deliver these tailored advertising on other websites and in mobile applications. These third parties may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform as discussed above and may access these cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform in order to serve these tailored advertisements.
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out  link or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out  link to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings  page .
We may use third-party service providers for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the Truste Privacy App available at: https://www.truste.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/ .
DO-NOT-TRACK SIGNALS AND SIMILAR MECHANISMS.
We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions.

Service Providers.  We may share information with third parties that help us operate our business and provide our services, such as contractors that provide us with technology, services, data or content, such as sale, marketing, billing, market research, advertising, analytics, identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal and accounting services.
App Store Providers . We may provide your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps.
Other Parties When Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services .   We may share information when we believe that doing so is necessary to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of GreatAt, our employees or agents or users, or to comply with applicable law or legal process, including responding to requests from public and government authorities.

Otherwise with Your Consent or at Your Direction . In addition to the sharing described in this Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.
Please be advised that some information you provide will be publicly accessible. For example,

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ZWILLGEN DRAFT 5-5-17
the information in your Profile, such as your name, photo, video, and information about what you are great at is publicly accessible on the Platform. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users. Depending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to other information, such as reviews about what you are great at. Certain other people, including other users with whom you have interacted via the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name. For example, others can see your ‘Seller Rating’, the number of ‘Reviews’ you have received, and the content of those reviews.
We invite you to post User Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited to, your comments, pictures, and any other information. However, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as composing a review of your experience with a Seller, that User Content (a) may be or may become publicly available; (b) may be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.
MINORS
The Platform is not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older may use the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.
SECURITY
We take technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. These measures vary depending on the sensitivity of the information we have collected from you. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES
The Platform contains links to third-party websites such as social media sites, and may also contain third-party plug-ins (such as the Facebook “like” button and Twitter “follow” button). If you choose to use these sites or features, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by GreatAt,

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ZWILLGEN DRAFT 5-5-17
GreatAt is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and other information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.
CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
GreatAt does not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their services to you unless you first agree to such disclosure. If you have any questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your preferences, you may contact us at https://www.greatat.com/contact .

INTERNATIONAL USERS AND CONSENT TO TRANSFER
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create an Account with the Platform as a visitor from outside the United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union or certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this Policy.

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ZWILLGEN DRAFT 5-5-17
which is available through the Platform. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently.
